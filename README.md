The weather dashboard is a website that lets you find the current weather and five day forcast for a searched city. It will also save the recently saved cities so that you can look back at cities that you searched.

## Using Weather Dashboard

To use the weather dashboard, you need to enter a city name into the search box and click the search button. This will display the current weather to the right, and below it a five day forcast for this city. After you search, the city you searched will be displayed below the search box. If you click on the name below the search box, it will search for that name automatically.
